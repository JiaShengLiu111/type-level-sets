This library provides type-level sets to Haskell, with a value level counterpart, and operations for taking the union, computing
subsets, and split sets. Also included is a "mapping" type constructor that pairs symbols with types. This can be used to represent
sets of variable-type pairs, which is used in the paper "Embedding effect systems in Haskell" (Dominic Orchard, 
Tomas Petricek <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf>) to embed effect sets. 

A full example can be seen in 'example.hs'. Here is a shorter version:

	{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeOperators #-}

	import Data.Type.Set

	-- foo :: Set '["x" :-> Int, "z" :-> Int]
	foo = Ext ((Var :: (Var "x")) :-> 2) $
	       Ext ((Var :: (Var "z")) :-> 4) $
	         Empty 

	-- bar :: Set '["y" :-> Int, "w" :-> Int]
	bar = Ext ((Var :: (Var "y")) :-> 3) $
       	      	  Ext ((Var :: (Var "w")) :-> 1) $
	               Empty 

	-- foobar :: Set '["w" :-> Int, "x" :-> Int, "y" :-> Int, "z" :-> Int]
	foobar = foo `union` bar

Note, that 'foobar' shows the sorted 
the type signatures are commented out here as they can be inferred. 
Example execution:

	*Main> foobar	
	{(Var :-> 1), (Var :-> 2), (Var :-> 3), (Var :-> 4)}
